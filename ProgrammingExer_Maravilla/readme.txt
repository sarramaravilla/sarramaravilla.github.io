This map shows the available green spaces in Metro Manila.
"Green Space" is either forest, grass, nature reserve, park or meadow.
This map is from the work of BA Racoma posted on Facebook last September 2019 and was featured in this article:https://interaksyon.philstar.com/trends-spotlights/2019/09/12/154749/green-spaces-parks-metro-manila/

The data has three types: cemetery, golf course and park.
You can use the layer control button to filter the data based on these types.

You can also switch the basemap layers using the two map options, streets and satellite.
